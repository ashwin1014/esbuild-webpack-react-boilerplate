# ðŸ“¦ React Boiler plate that combines webpack5 and esbuild

A React boilerplate that combines the Webpack ecosystem and esbuild's fast build/transpilation speed.

## Installation

Clone this repo and npm install.

```bash
npm i or yarn install
```

## Usage

### Development server

```bash
npm start or yarn start
```

You can view the development server at `localhost:3000`.

### Production build

```bash
npm run build or yarn build
```

## Project Features

### 1) **Component Scaffolding:** [Plop](https://plopjs.com/) - Easily create pages/components with consistency using the below command. Automatically creates Js, Scss and localization files at required directories. Templates can be modified by editing 'plopfile.js' file and 'plop-templates' directory.

```bash
npm generate or yarn generate
```

### 2) **Module Aliases:** Below are the list of aliases. These can be configured in webpack.config.js file

```
    "paths": {
      "@icons/*": ["src/assets/icons/*"],
      "@images/*": ["src/assets/images/*"],
      "@config/*": ["src/config/*"],
      "@constants/*": ["src/constants/*"],
      "@hooks/*": ["src/hooks/*"],
      "@hoc/*": ["src/hoc/*"],
      "@localization/*": ["src/localization/*"],
      "@sharedComponents/*": ["src/sharedComponents/*"],
      "@pages/*": ["src/app/pages/*"],
      "@utils/*": ["src/utils/*"],
      "@/*": ["src*"]
    };
```

```javascript
  /*Usage*/
  import { Space } from '@sharedComponents';
  import { FaBeer } from '@icons';
  .
  .
  .
  <Space><p>Hello</p><p>World</p><Space>
  <FaBeer />

```

### 3) **Styles**: Both sass and styled components have been added along with global variables.

```javascript
import styled from 'styled-components';

const Container = styled.div`
  display: flex;
  font-size: ${(props) => props.theme.fontLg2};
`;
```

### 4) **Pre-configured route based splitting [Loadable Components](https://loadable-components.com/docs/getting-started)**; Import and add your routes to Routes.config.js in base directory.

```javascript
 import { lazy } from '@loadable/component';

 const About = lazy(() => import('@pages/About'));
 export const ROUTES = [
   .
   .
   .
   .
  {
    path: '/about',
    key: 'About',
    exact: true,
    component: About
  }
];
```

### 5) **Optimization**:

- [`ImageMinimizerWebpackPlugin`](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/image-minimizer-webpack-plugin/) - Lossless compression of images using imagemin plugin
- [`compression-webpack-plugin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/compression-webpack-plugin) - Pre-configured "brotli" compress to prepare compressed versions of assets to serve them with Content-Encoding.

### 6) **SVG as React Components**: [@svgr/cli](https://react-svgr.com/docs/cli/)

```
/* 1) Place your svgs in assets/icons/svg folder*/
/* 2) run below command from cli */
```

```bash
yarn svgr or npm svgr
```

The above command will automatically create the React component in assets/icons folder;

usage:

```javascript
import { SadIcon } from '@icons';

<SadIcon />;
```

### 6) **Safe Commits**:

- [`lint-staged`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lint-staged) - Run linters against staged git files and don't let ðŸ’© slip into your code base!
- [`Husky`](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) - configured git hooks that runs "lint-staged" on committing your code and before push to repo.

### 7) **Secure Locale Storage**:

- [`secure-ls`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/secure-ls) - Secure localStorage data with high level of encryption and data compression.

usage:

```javascript
import { setLocalStorage, getLocalStorageKey } from '@utils/secureLocalStorage';

setLocalStorage('token', resp.accessToken);
const token = getLocalStorageKey('token');
```
